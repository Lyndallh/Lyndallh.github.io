            <h1>Group Project - DiversiTech</h1>
            <p>Our final project for the She Codes Plus program was to work in a team of 6 to create a web platform for a client that helped to connect people in tech who are typically underrepresented and usually find it difficult to find other 'people like them' to connect with.</p>
            <br>
            <p> We used Agile Methodology to plan, design, build and test the project. We also used the following tools to aid in our collaboration and project management:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li> Mural to design the user-stories and map out a basic database model </li>
                    <li> Google Drive to collate and refine requirements gathering</li>
                    <li> Trello to manage our tasks</li>
                    <li> GitHub to collaborate our code </li>
                    <li> Slack to communicate with each other </li>
                    <li> Google Meet to host our stand up meetings </li>
                    <li> Figma to design the wireframes and the final design of the app. </li>
                    <li> React JS to create the front end </li>
                    <li> Django REST Framework to create the back end.</li>
                    <li> fly.io to deploy the back end </li>
                    <li> Netlify to deploy the front end. </li>
                    <li> Insomnia to test the API end points and back end server</li>
                    <li> dbshell to run SQlite3 to run the commandline client to query and manage the deployed database</li>
                </ul>

                    <h2>Django Rest Framework - Back End</h2>
                    <p>The back-end of the project used DRF to create a database and API server that receives GET, POST, PUT and DELETE API calls from our React JS front end app.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My main contribution to the back end of this project was in the design and administration of the database</p>

                    <h2>React JS - Front End</h2>
                    <p>The client side app used React JS, HTML, CSS and JavaScript that sends GET, POST, PUT and DELETE API calls to our Django REST Framework back end server.</a></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Users can create an account, create a profile, filter profiles by multiple selections, view a single profile and if they are logged in, they can obtain contact details to connect to the profile owner.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My main contrubution to the client side app was the filtering functionality. I also created the bones of the user sign-up, login and create profile forms</p>
