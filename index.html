                    <h3>Analytics</h3>
                    <p>I am an experienced Data Analyst with a passion for problem solving. I have always been fascinated by data and how I can use it to tell a story and provide a better understanding of complex problems to help make big decisions. I love the challenge of sifting through vast amounts of information to uncover hidden patterns and insights. </p>

                    <h3>Bikes</h3>
                    <p>I’m also passionate about bike riding. Whether it's for fun, for sport, for a healthier mind, body and planet, or for a deeper connection to surroundings and community, each pedal stroke brings me joy. Knowing the benefits of cycling, I'm a strong advocate for encouraging others to embrace cycling as a regular and rewarding activity.</p>

                    <h3>Coding</h3>
                    <p>I’m always looking for ways to improve my skills and stay on the cutting edge of technology. I'm delighted to have been awarded a scholarship from Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre to undertake the She Codes Plus program to learn HTML/CSS, Javascript, Python, React, WordPress and Django. This is website serves as my portfolio of projects to showcase my new skills to the world.</p>
